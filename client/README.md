# LocalChat Client


## About

Localchat is a simple and lightweight chat application. It's primary purpose is to provide a means to have a multi-user Off-The-Record transient chat, minimising the likelihood that anyone but the chat participants has even a record that the chat took place.

This client uses basic End To End encryption (currently using PGP as the encryption mechanism), and the server holds encrypted payloads in memory only (to ensure the ciphertext doesn't end up captured on the hosting provider's SAN for a time). 

The default behaviour is a Multi-User Chat (MUC), however direct messaging between participants within a room is also supported.
